# Chat Application using with ReactJS, Ionic and Firebase

## Overview

This is a responsive chat application which can be run on any device.

For testing:
    
Desktop/Browser -  [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100)

Android - Download and install the .apk provided in Link.

iOS - Download and install the .ipa provided in Link.

Note: I have used ionic to run and build the app as I have built this app to support all possible devices.

If you want to run it only for locally you can run is using react also.

## For testing locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/build) for more information.
